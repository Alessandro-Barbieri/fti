* FTI stands for Fault Tolerance Interface and is a library that aims to give
* computational scientists the means to perform fast and efficient multilevel
* checkpointing in large scale supercomputers. FTI leverages local storage plus
* data replication and erasure codes to provide several levels of reliability and
* performance. FTI is application-level checkpointing and allows users to select
* which datasets needs to be protected, in order to improve efficiency and avoid
* wasting space, time and energy. In addition, it offers a direct data interface
* so that users do not need to deal with files and/or directory names.  All
* metadata is managed by FTI in a transparent fashion for the user. If desired,
* users can dedicate one process per node to overlap fault tolerance workload and
* scientific computation, so that post-checkpoint tasks are executed
* asynchronously.

*##########   Download, compile and install FTI (as easy as 1,2,3)   ##########
*
* 1) git clone https://github.com/leobago/fti.git
*
* 2) mkdir fti/build && cd fti/build
*
* 3) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/install/here/fti .. && make all install
* 
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* NOTICE
* For the case that both, intel and gnu compilers are installed, please confi-
* gure using:
*
* cmake -C ../intel.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/install/here/fti ..
*
* To use built-in MD5 rather than OpenSSL, please configure using:
*
* cmake -DNO_OPENSSL=true -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/install/here/fti ..
*
*##########             Configure and run a FTI example              ##########
*
* Place yourself in the examples directory which contains head distribution
* examples in both C and Fortran. Futher instructions in "examples/README".
