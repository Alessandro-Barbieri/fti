After "cmake" and "make all install" calls, run examples by going to fti/build/examples and execute:
make hd 	- runs first example (heatdis.c)
make hd2 	- runs second example (heatd2.c)
make hdf	- runs third example (fheatdis.f90)
make runall 	- runs all examples

After running hd2 execute plot.sh and go to "results" folder to see PNG files with graphs.
